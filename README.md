# 🥗 MealConnect - Turning Excess into Access

## About
**Meal Connect** is a community-driven platform that bridges the gap between surplus and need — connecting restaurants, NGOs, and individuals to reduce food waste and fight hunger.

## Mission
Our mission is to create a world where no meal is wasted and no person goes hungry by transforming surplus food into shared hope through smart, seamless connections.

## For Restaurants (Donors)
Restaurants and food providers can easily list surplus food through their dashboard.  
Each donation includes dish details, pickup location, and expiry time.  
Once submitted, it becomes visible to nearby NGOs who can claim it instantly.  
Donors can track pickups, view past donations, and even sponsor meals financially.

## For NGOs (Receivers)
Registered NGOs can browse and claim available food donations in real time.  
Their dashboard provides live stats, delivery coordination, volunteer assignments, and donation history — ensuring every meal reaches someone in need efficiently.

## For Individuals (Supporters)
Anyone can contribute by donating food, sponsoring meals, or offering monetary support.  
Home donors can schedule pickups, while sponsors can fund pre-set meal packs.  
Every contribution directly feeds those in need and reflects in an impact summary for transparency.

## For Volunteers
Volunteers can register to assist with pickups and deliveries.  
They receive live tasks, track routes, and update statuses — ensuring timely and safe distribution.

##  Smart Features
-  AI Chatbot Assistant for quick help and guidance  
-  Global search bar for seamless navigation  
-  Notifications for donation and delivery updates  
-  Interactive partner map showing active NGOs and restaurants  
-  Secure online payment and live donation tracking  

## Vision
To build a connected ecosystem where compassion meets technology, turning every extra bite into a step toward ending hunger and food waste.

##  Built Using the MERN Stack
MongoDB for data storage, Express and Node.js for backend APIs, and React for a responsive frontend interface.
